  %div
    To get started:
    %ul
      %li= "As a admin, register the user who will be texting (their name and phone number):"
      %li.simple-user-form
        = simple_form_for User.new, method: :post, html: {class: 'form-inline'} do |f|
          = f.input :name, label: 'Name: ', class: 'form-control mb-2 mr-sm-2'
          = f.input :phone_number, label: 'Phone number: ', placeholder: 'eg. +12223334444', class: 'form-control mb-2 mr-sm-2'
          = f.button :submit, 'Register', id: 'submit-new-user', class: 'btn btn-primary'
      %li Then as a user, text 'help me' to +15799771147 to see available commands.
